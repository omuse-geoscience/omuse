Test the cdo-operators
======================

To test the cdo operators use:
    make
or
    make test
or
    ./test_operators

The cdo operators are tested with python-unittests using the python-bindings for cdo.
The python-bindings are located at cdo/contrib/python/cdo.py.
The use is roughly exlained at:
    https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo/wiki/Cdo%7Brbpy%7D
    TODO: Provide a more thorough documentation/tutorial.
The documentation of the python unittest framework can be found at:
    http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html

The tests are grouped by operator. An operator is tested with the help of its file test_operator.py, which can comprise several tests.
