CDO - Climate Data Operators
----------------------------

     This package contains the source code for CDO. This program was developed at the 
     Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology.
     CDO is a collection of Operators to manipulate and analyse Climate model Data.
     Supported data formats are GRIB, netCDF, SERVICE, EXTRA and IEG.

     CDO is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2.

Operators:

     There are more than 400 operators available. Read OPEATORS for
     a short overview of all operators.

Documentation:

     A detailed description of all operators can be found in: ./doc/cdo.pdf

     Online reference manuals:   cdo -h <operator>

Building and installing it:

     1. Run ./configure, with some options if you wish. The standard
        options are documented in the INSTALL file. The configuration
        script has some more options; type 'configure -h' to see them.

        The most interesting ones are the usual
          --prefix=<installation directory> and
          --with-netcdf=<directory> to enable netCDF support.

        The netCDF-4 configuration depends on the netCDF-4 and HDF5 installation!
	You have to define the location of the HDF5 installation if netCDF-4 was 
        build with HDF5 support:
 
          --with-netcdf=<netCDF-4 root directory> --with-hdf5=<HDF5 root directory> 

        You have to specify also the location of the SZLIB if HDF5 was build
        with SZLIB support. If only the linking is required, you can directly
        set the linking path with --with-szlib-lib=<dir>, --with-zlib-lib=<dir>
        and --with-hdf5-lib=<dir>

        To process szip compressed GRIB files you have to enable SZLIB support with:
          --with-szlib=<directory>

     2. Do "make" to compile the program.

     3. (Optional) Do "make install", possibly as root if the destination
        permissions require that. This installs CDO in the directory
        specified during configuration. The default prefix is /usr/local.

Porting:

     This package was designed for maximum portability. It is written entirely
     in ANSI C99, and will compile on most UNIX platforms.
