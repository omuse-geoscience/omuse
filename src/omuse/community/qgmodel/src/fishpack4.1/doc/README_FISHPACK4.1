CAVEAT
------
FISHPACK 4.1 is written in Fortran 77 but it does not fully comply with the 
Fortran 77 standard. It breaks the standard by calling routines with one type 
of argument and later uses the argument as another type.  There may be other
violations as well. Users whose applications require strict adherence to the 
standard should not use FISHPACK 4.1.

Documentation

Documentation for this software package is provided in file FISHPACK4.1.html
and companion image file FISH.gif.  We intend the document for display on your 
browser.

Recent bugfixes
---------------
None. This library is regarded as legacy, and no problems other than standards
violations have been reported for several years.

Compiling the Library and Test Programs
---------------------------------------
Our Makefile requires gmake and a Fortran 90 compiler to make the library and test 
executables.  It is configured to build a static library on several popular unix 
and unix-like operating systems; a Fortran compiler is required on the system where 
you are executing the Makefile.

Examine file make.inc to see if your OS and compiler are represented.  If they 
are not, you should modify file make.inc and the Makefile in each directory 
(main, src and test) so that they are represented.

The source code is primarily Fortran 77 syntax for single precision floating-point 
arithmetic.  If you desire double precision, you should modify Makefile and make.inc 
with compiler options for promoting real to double precision.  Your compiler's user 
guide will have information on the required compiler options.
